<h1 class="homepage">STRUCTURE OF US PRO SPORTS</h1>
<main>
    <p>Pro Sports in the United States are all structured in a similar manner. At the base level, teams represent large cities, such as New York city or Los Angeles. These teams are typically organized into "divisions," such as the AFC and NFC in American Football. These have their roots in long travel distances common in US and Canadian sports; to cut down on travel, leagues are typically divided into geographic divisions and feature unbalanced schedules with teams playing more matches against opponents in the same division. The best teams in a given season reach a playoff tournament, and the winner of the playoffs is crowned champion of the league. American and Canadian sports leagues typically have such "playoff" systems. The championships of the three largest American leagues - the NFL, MLB, and NBA - are some of the largest sporting events in the world, and are televised to millions on a global scale.</p>
