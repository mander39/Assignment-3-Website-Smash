					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>The New York Mets were founded in 1962 to replace the New Yorks recently departed teams, the Dodgers and the Giants. The nickname "Mets" was adopted: it was a natural shorthand to the club's corporate name, "The New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.", hearkened back to the "Metropolitans" (a former New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887), and its brevity was advantageous for newspaper headlines.For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games at the historic  Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan. In 1964, they moved into newly constructed Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, where the Mets played until the 2008 season. In 2009, the club moved into Citi Field, adjacent to the former Shea Stadium site.</p>

			<h2>New York Jets</h2>
			<div class="wrapper2">
				<div class="box2 x">
					<h3>Championships</h3>
					<p>The Jets' owners hired Weeb Ewbank as the general manager and head coach.

					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>The first organizational meeting of the American Football League took place on August 14, 1959. Harry Wismer, representing the city of New York at the meeting, proclaimed the state was ready for another professional football team and that he was more than capable of running the daily operations.</p>
					<p>Wismer was granted the charter franchise later dubbed the Titans of New York as Wismer explained, "Titans are bigger and stronger than Giants". He secured the Titans' home field at the decrepit Polo Grounds, where the team struggled financially and on the field during its first three years. By 1962, the debt continued to mount for Wismer, forcing the AFL to assume the costs of the team until season's end.</p>
					<p>Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1984.</p>

					<h3>Players</h3>
					<p>Despite the team's continuous run of mediocrity (with a few playoff seasons sprinkled in over the years), the Jets have had a lot of talent on both sides of the ball. Joe Namath, Curtis Martin, Darrelle Revis, Don Maynard and Mark Gastineau are all considered some of the best Jets ever. These players are either in the Pro Football Hall of Fame or are considered some of the best players at their positions. </p>
